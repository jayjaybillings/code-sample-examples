# code-sample-examples
This is a project with code samples in multiple languages following the style discussed here [my blog article on this topic](https://jayjaybillings.com/2018/01/31/what-does-a-good-code-sample-look-like/).

## Sample Languages

C++ - Simple planet example with some CSV I/O and a Makefile.
Julia - Barebones Julia example created with PkgTemplates and showing a some basic operations. (Not yet implemented.)

## A note on licenses and copyrights.

Each example is individually licensed with copyrights held by their respective owners, both of which are noted as such. Most, if not all, licenses are New (3-clause) BSD and most copyrights are my own. However, I wrote the C++ example when I worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2018 and it is copyrighted by UT-Battelle LLC. The entire C++ example is reproduced under the original conditions (until I decide to rewrite it). It was the only component of the original repository, and the additional in this fork are unrelated.
